# Vanilla Javascript Countdown

Simple countdown using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. Can be used to launch any service on internet.

I use to organize my scripts: Selectors, Events and Functions; It can be very helpfull, if you are a beginner.

There are comments to help you, guys.

I'll create a dark mode button. I hope you enjoy.
